# 📊 Databel Customer Churn Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Databel, a fictitious telecom provider, was facing a major challenge: **a significant number of customers were churning (leaving the company)**. This project analyzes customer data to uncover the key reasons behind churn and provide actionable business recommendations to reduce it.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** Databel (fictitious dataset)  
- **Columns:** 29 customer-related features (demographics, service usage, contracts, devices, churn reason, etc.)  
- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes/No)  

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Excel / Google Sheets**  
  - Pivot Tables (data summarization)  
  - Nested IF Functions (binning age groups & categorizing usage)  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
  - Checked data quality (missing values, inconsistencies)  
  - Understood data distributions & relationships  
  - Visualized churn rates across features  

👉 **Benefits of EDA:**  
- Detects trends and hidden patterns  
- Identifies anomalies in customer behavior  
- Highlights important variables that affect churn  

## 🔍 Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Understanding (EDA)** → explored demographics, contracts, usage, and churn reasons.  
2. **Pivot Tables** → summarized churn rates by country, age groups, and data usage.  
3. **Binning** → grouped customers into age ranges & data consumption levels.  
4. **Churn Reason Analysis** → identified top reasons for customer churn.  
5. **Comparison with Competitors** → analyzed competitor offers and devices.  

## 📈 Key Findings  
1. **Top Churn Reason:**  
   - *Competitor made a better offer* → strongest cause of churn.  
   - *Competitor had better devices* → second most common cause.  
   - ✅ **Recommendation:** Improve service packages & upgrade devices.  

2. **Churn Rate:**  
   - **26.86%** of total customers churned.  

3. **Age Effect:**  
   - Highest churn among **seniors (79–88 years old)**.  

4. **Data Usage:**  
   - Most churned customers used **5–10 GB/month**.  

5. **Geographical Distribution:**  
   - Country with the highest churn: **Canada (CA)**.
